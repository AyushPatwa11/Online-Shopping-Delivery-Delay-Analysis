## 🚀 How to Run the Project (For Evaluation)

### 🔹 Method 1: Run Locally (Recommended for Teachers)
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open a terminal in the project directory
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
4. Run the Streamlit application: streamlit run app.py
5. Open the browser at: http://localhost:8501
The interactive website dashboard will open automatically

Method 2: Run Using Google Colab

1. Open the provided notebook in Google Colab
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Execute the Streamlit app
4. The successful execution logs confirm that the web application is running correctly on localhost
(Note: Google Colab blocks direct access to localhost UI, but the app runs without errors.)
